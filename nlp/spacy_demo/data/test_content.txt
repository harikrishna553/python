"Cricket is a popular sport played in many countries (like India, Australia, South Africa etc.,) around the world. It is a bat-and-ball game that involves two teams, typically consisting of 11 players each. The game is played on an oval or circular field with a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch in the center.
The objective of the game is for one team to score runs by hitting the ball with a bat and running between the wickets. The opposing team, known as the fielding team, tries to prevent the batting team from scoring runs by getting the batsmen out. There are various ways to get a batsman out, such as getting them bowled, caught, or run out.
Cricket has different formats, including Test cricket, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20) cricket. Test cricket is known for its longer duration and strategic gameplay, while ODIs and T20s are faster-paced formats with limited overs.
Some of the world's most famous cricketers include Sachin Tendulkar, Sir Don Bradman, and Sir Vivian Richards. These players have left a lasting impact on the sport with their exceptional skills and records.
Cricket is more than just a sport; it's a source of national pride and brings people together. Major tournaments like the Cricket World Cup and The Ashes series are celebrated with great enthusiasm by fans worldwide."
